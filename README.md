# 🛰️ BeaconAR

**BeaconAR** brings a live social layer to the real world using augmented reality. Built for Snap Spectacles, this project lets event-goers instantly see who’s around them, what others are looking for (chat, collab, job, dance?), and whether they’re open to connect — all through floating AR badges anchored above people’s heads.

It’s like real-life LinkedIn, Hinge, and a conference app — all at a glance.

## 👀 What It Does

At live events, it’s often hard to know who’s open to conversation, what someone does, or why they’re here. **Beacon** changes that:

- **Live AR Badges** — show real-time social status: name, intent, openness to chat  
- **Gesture-Based Connections** — high-five or handshake to connect  
- **Face-Tracked Identity** — floating badges above heads via Snap Lens Studio  
- **Context-Aware Profiles** — adapt info display for conferences, concerts, festivals  
- **Event-Based Customization** — each event has its own profile template

## 🌟 Core Interactions

- 👀 **Live AR Feedback**  
  Badges update in real time based on connection status and intent.

- 🤝 **Gesture-Based Connection**  
  A handshake or high-five instantly connects attendees.

- 🧭 **AR Navigation** *(upcoming)*  
  Navigate rooms, booths, or speakers with floating AR arrows.

- 🗂️ **Dynamic Profiles**  
  Profiles adapt based on the type of event (e.g., job seeker at a conference vs. mood at a festival).

## 🔧 How It Works

Developed in **Snap Lens Studio**, Beacon uses a combination of AR tools and logic systems:

- **👤 Face Tracking**  
  Anchors floating AR elements (badges) above users' heads in real-world space.

- **🔄 Sync Entity API**  
  Synchronizes live connection status and identity data across multiple users’ devices.

- **🧠 Interaction Kit**  
  Handles UI interactions, onboarding, and gesture recognition within the AR experience.

> ⚠️ The project’s success is closely tied to AR glasses (Snap Spectacles) and the ability to reliably sync data between users.

## 🧪 Future Vision

We plan to pilot Beacon at small- to mid-sized events to explore:

- Technical feasibility of multi-user syncing  
- UX potential of live AR-driven social cues  
- Value proposition for organizers, sponsors, and users  
- Opportunities for collaboration with Snap’s AR ecosystem

## 🧭 Designed for Any Live Event

### 🎓 At Conferences:
- Show name, title, and intent (e.g. “looking for cofounder”)
- Display availability with visual "social battery"
- Match with collaborators or recruiters in real time

### 🎵 At Festivals:
- Share vibe and openness (“just here to dance”, “down to chat”)
- Display pronouns, orientation, and mood
- Discover new connections based on shared energy
